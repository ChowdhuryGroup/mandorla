# Mandorla-Suite
A collection of Python Scripts to help me in the lab.

There are several different libraries broken into different modules organized (roughly) by category.

Orchard - Plotting library based on Matplotlib

Opticstoolkit - Various optics calculations and data processing (e.g. GVD, Sellmeier eq., etc...)

Labclerk - Library for importing/exporting and organizing data files \n
